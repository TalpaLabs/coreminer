# coreminer

* [GitHub](https://github.com/debugger-bs/coreminer)
* [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/coreminer)
* [Documentation on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/coreminer/latest/coreminer/)

A powerful debugger written in Rust that provides low-level debugging capabilities for programs that may not want to be debugged. Coreminer gives you deep control over program execution with robust DWARF debug information parsing.

## Features

- **Execution Control**: Set breakpoints, step through code, continue execution
- **Memory & Register Access**: Read from and write to process memory and CPU registers
- **Variable Inspection**: Read and write application variables using DWARF debug symbols
- **Stack Unwinding**: Generate and analyze stack backtraces
- **Disassembly**: View disassembled code at specific addresses
- **Process Inspection**: View process maps and executable layouts
- **Plugin System**: Extend debugger capabilities with custom plugins (v0.3.0+)
- **Plugin Management**: Enable/disable plugins at runtime (v0.4.0+)
- **Sigtrap Guard Plugin**: Protrect from detection through self registering a handler on SIGTRAP

## Installation

### Additional system dependencies

To compile, coreminer depends on `libunwind-dev`. On Debian, it can be installed like
this. Other distributions provide similar packages.

```bash
apt install libunwind-dev
```

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install coreminer
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debugger-bs/coreminer.git
cd coreminer
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `./target/release/cm`.

## Quick Start

### Launch Coreminer

You can launch Coreminer with an optional executable path as a default target:

```bash
# Launch Coreminer without a target
cm

# Launch Coreminer with a default executable
cm ./target/debug/dummy
```

## Command-Line Interface

Coreminer provides a simple CLI that allows you to interact with the debugger. The interface supports command history for ease of use.

Once in the Coreminer CLI, you can use:

```
# Run a program with arguments
run ./target/debug/dummy arg1 arg2

# If launched with a default executable, you can run it with:
run

# Set a breakpoint at a specific address (hex)
bp 0x0000563087528176

# Continue execution
c

# Step over instructions
s
step

# View disassembly at some address, 20 bytes
d 0x0000563087528176 20

# View disassembly at some address, 20 bytes, showing the code exactly how it is
# in memory - including the int3 instructions set by breakpoints
d 0x0000563087528176 20 --literal

# Read registers
regs get

# View process memory
rmem 0x7fffffffe000

# Backtrace the call stack
bt

# Read a variable by name (requires debug information)
var my_variable_name

# Inspect a debug symbol (requires debug information)
sym main
sym i
```

A list of all commands can be gotten with `help`:

```

## JSON Interface

From `v0.2.0`, Coreminer includes a second binary: `cmserve`. `cmserve` provides
all internal functionalities of the Coreminer debugger, but can be
scripted. This enables projects such as [hardhat](https://github.com/debugger-bs/hardhat)
to build a better user interface for Coreminer.

To see some example inputs (statuses) and outputs (feedbacks), you can use
`cmserve --example-statuses --example-feedbacks`.

## Use Cases

- **Reverse Engineering**: Analyze and understand program behavior
- **Debugging Stripped Binaries**: Debug programs with limited debugging information
- **Security Research**: Analyze potentially malicious code in a controlled environment
- **Low-level Debugging**: Step through compiled code precisely

## Architecture

Coreminer is built around several key components:

- **Debuggee Control**: Via Linux ptrace API
- **DWARF Debug Info**: For symbol resolution and variable information
- **Stack Unwinding**: Using libunwind
- **Disassembly**: Powered by iced-x86
- **Plugin System**: Extensibility via [steckrs](https://github.com/PlexSheep/steckrs)

## Examples

The [examples](./examples/) directory contains a few small programs that serve
as debuggees. You can try coreminer on them and see what happens.

They can be compiled in debug or release mode with [`build-dummy.sh`](./build-dummy.sh) and
[`build-release.sh`](./build-release.sh).

The [examples](./examples/) directory also contains an example plugin.
